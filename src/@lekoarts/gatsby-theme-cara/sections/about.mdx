## About

I am a 20 year old software developer that lives in Louisville, KY, USA. I got my programming start when I was only 10 making modifications to some of my favorite video games in Java and Python. Digging into these video games and seeing the inner workings of the programs sparked my interest in software engineering, and the rest is history! I am currently a Front End Developer at KFC, and I mainly focus my efforts on KFC.com and furthering developements in e-commerce. My username online is @ASThome, which I have had since childhood.

## Experience

I have almost 11 years of experience in software development, and am comfortable with C, C#, C++, Java, Python, SQL, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and have an excellent grasp on the generics of software. I also have over 4 years of experience working in customer service, and over half a year of experience managing and architecting for other developers.
